Meepo Documentation
===================

Welcome to meepo's documentation. Meepo is a event sourcing and broadcasting
platform for database.

This documentation consists of two parts:

1. Meepo PubSub (`meepo.pub` & `meepo.sub`). This part is enough if you
   only needs a simple solution for your database events.

2. Meepo Apps (`meepo.apps`). This part ships with eventsourcing and
   replicator apps for advanced use. You can refer to examples for demo.

Meepo source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/eleme/meepo

Features
========

Meepo can be used to do lots of things, including replication, eventsourcing,
cache refresh/invalidate, real-time analytics etc. The limit is all the tasks
should be row-based, since meepo only gives ``table_action`` -> ``pk``
style events.

* Row-based database replication.

  Meepo can be used to replicate data between databases including
  postgres, sqlite, etc.

  Refer to ``examples/repl_db`` script for demo.

* Replicate RDBMS to NoSQL and search engine.

  Meepo can also be used to replicate data changes from RDBMS to redis,
  elasticsearch etc.

  Refer to ``examples/repl_redis`` and ``examples/repl_elasticsearch`` for
  demo.

* Event Sourcing.

  Meepo can log and replay what has happened since some time using a simple
  event sourcing.

  Refer to ``examples/event_sourcing`` for demo.

.. note::

   Meepo can only replicate row based data, which means it DO NOT replicate
   schema changes, or bulk operations.


Installation
============

.. highlight:: bash

:Requirements: **Python 2.x >= 2.7** or **Python 3.x >= 3.2** or **PyPy**

To install the latest released version of Meepo::

    $ pip install meepo


Usage
=====

Meepo use blinker signal to hook into the events of mysql binlog and
sqlalchemy, the hook is very easy to install.

Hook with MySQL's binlog events:

.. code:: python

    from meepo.pub import mysql_pub
    mysql_pub(mysql_dsn)

Hook with SQLAlchemy's events:

.. code:: python

    from meepo.pub import sqlalchemy_pub
    sqlalchemy_pub(session)

Then you can connect to the signal and do tasks based the signal:

.. code:: python

    sg = signal("test_write")

    @sg.connect
    def print_test_write(primary_key):
        print("test_write -> %s" % primary_key)

Try out the demo scripts in ``example/tutorial`` for more about how meepo
event works.
